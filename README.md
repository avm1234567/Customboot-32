# Customboot-32

**Custom PCB integrating ESP32-WROOM-32D & STM32F103C8T6 with OTA Firmware Update & Custom Bootloader**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to design a **custom PCB** integrating the powerful **ESP32-WROOM-32D** and **STM32F103C8T6** microcontrollers. The ESP32 acts as the primary firmware manager, receiving updates via **OTA (Over-The-Air)**, storing them securely in SPIFFS, and transmitting them to the STM32 MCU over UART.

A **custom bootloader** on the STM32 coordinates firmware requests from the ESP32 based on user inputs, ensuring robust and reliable firmware flashing with CRC validation for data integrity.
