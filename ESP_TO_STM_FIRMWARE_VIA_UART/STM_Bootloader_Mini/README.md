This is a PlatformIO project accessible using platformIO extension in VS code.
This is the LibOpenCM3 version of the bootloader(Learning_Bootloader) written in HAL.
The main objective of making this is to learn Bare-Metal coding and to reduce size of bootloader to provide more space for larger firmwares to run.
This prevents unnecessary bloatware in our final compiled .bin file.
